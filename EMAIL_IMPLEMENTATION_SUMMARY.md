# Email Functionality Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented multiple email account support for the EmailModal component with proper API organization and React hooks integration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Type Definitions (`src/components/types.ts`)

Added email-related TypeScript interfaces:

- `EmailAccount` - Structure for email account information
- `EmailSendRequest` - Request payload for sending emails
- `EmailSendResponse` - Response structure from email API
- `EmailAccountsResponse` - Response structure for email accounts list

### 2. API Services (`src/components/hooks/ApiServices.tsx`)

Added email API functions:

- `fetchEmailAccounts()` - Retrieves available email accounts from backend
- `sendEmail()` - Sends email using specified account
- `testEmailConnection()` - Tests email configuration
- Created separate `emailApi` instance using `AppConfig.emailApiUrl`
- Added proper error handling and logging

### 3. Data Hooks (`src/components/hooks/UseData.ts`)

- Added `emailAccounts` query using React Query
- Integrated email accounts fetching with caching (5-minute refresh interval)
- Added `sendEmail` mutation to the hook
- Exported email-related data and functions

### 4. Mutations (`src/components/hooks/UseMutations.ts`)

- Added `useSendEmail()` mutation hook
- Integrated with socket notifications for real-time updates
- Proper error handling and success callbacks

### 5. EmailModal Component (`src/components/Emails/EmailModal.tsx`)

**Major Refactor:**

- Removed inline API calls and replaced with hooks
- Added dropdown for email account selection
- Integrated with `useData()` hook for email accounts and sending
- Improved user experience with proper loading states
- Auto-selects first email account when accounts are loaded
- Maintains all existing functionality (acknowledgment/general emails)

## Backend Integration

The frontend now properly integrates with the backend email API:

- Uses correct endpoint `/api/email/accounts` for fetching accounts
- Uses correct endpoint `/api/email/send` for sending emails
- Proper authentication headers (`x-electron-app-secret`)
- Error handling for network and API failures

## Features

1. **Multiple Email Accounts**: Dropdown showing all available accounts (APS, Mannie, Willie, Elize)
2. **Account Auto-Selection**: Automatically selects first account when loaded
3. **Proper Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and fallbacks
4. **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during email operations
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces
6. **Caching**: Email accounts are cached and refreshed intelligently
7. **Real-time Updates**: Socket integration for real-time notifications

## Testing

The implementation should now:

- Show all 4 email accounts in the dropdown (not just APS)
- Allow users to select different sending accounts
- Properly send emails from the selected account
- Display success/error messages with account information
- Cache email accounts to reduce API calls

## File Organization

- API logic moved to `hooks/ApiServices.tsx` (centralized)
- Data fetching logic in `hooks/UseData.ts` (React Query integration)
- Mutations in `hooks/UseMutations.ts` (consistent pattern)
- Component logic simplified and focused on UI concerns

## Known Issues Fixed

1. ✅ Only APS account showing in dropdown - now shows all accounts
2. ✅ API calls directly in component - moved to hooks
3. ✅ Missing error handling - comprehensive error handling added
4. ✅ Type safety issues - full TypeScript implementation
5. ✅ Code organization - proper separation of concerns

The email functionality is now properly organized, type-safe, and should display all available email accounts in the dropdown.
